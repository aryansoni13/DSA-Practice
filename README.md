Welcome to my **DSA Practice** repository ‚Äî a coding journal of my **#365DaysOfCode** challenge  
Every day, I‚Äôm solving and uploading problems related to **Data Structures and Algorithms** to boost my problem-solving skills, improve coding logic, and prepare for interviews & contests.

## üõ†Ô∏è Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Trees & BSTs  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Math & Bit Manipulation  
- Searching, Sorting, Sliding Window  
- Graphs, BFS, DFS  
- And more as the journey unfolds...
