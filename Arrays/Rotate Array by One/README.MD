##### [Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/cyclically-rotate-an-array-by-one2614/1)


## Problem Description
Given an array arr, rotate the array by one position in clockwise direction.
### Examples
**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation: If we rotate arr by one position in clockwise 5 come to the front and remaining those are shifted to the end.
```


**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr[] = [9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3]
Output: [3, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1]
Explanation: After rotating clock-wise 3 comes in first position.
```


### Constraints
- 1<=arr.size()<=10^5
- 0<=arr[i]<=10^5
